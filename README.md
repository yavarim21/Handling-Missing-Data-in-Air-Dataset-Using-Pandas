#Handling Missing Data in Air Quality Dataset

This project demonstrates diagnosing and analyzing missing values in an air quality dataset using R and Pandas. It applies visualizations, statistical tests (t-test, chi-square), and exploratory analysis to assess whether missing values occur randomly or systematically across numerical and categorical attributes.

Key outcomes:

Identified that missing values in NO2_Location_A are randomly distributed.

Applied best practices for data cleaning and preprocessing for downstream modeling.

Skills highlighted: Data cleaning, statistical analysis, R, Pandas, visualization, reproducible workflow.
